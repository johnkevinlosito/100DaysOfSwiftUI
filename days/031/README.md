# Day 31 – Project 5: WordScramble part 3

_[https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/31](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/31)_

## Challenge

1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
2. Add a toolbar button that calls `startGame()`, so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
