This last part is a wrap up/review plus a challenge.

## Challenge

1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
3. Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%. Tip: use the range 0..<101 for your range rather than a fixed array.

I decided not to do the third one because I find it better in terms of UI/UX to use segmented control and just a couple of items to choose from. :wink:
