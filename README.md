# 100 Days of SwiftUI

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This project is meant to collate notes, projects, playgrounds, and other materials made while following along with [Paul Hudsonâ€™s 100 Days of SwiftUI course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

I came from a web development background and has decided to take the leap into the iOS/mobile development route - thus, taking Paul's free course as the first step.
